# D-Mail: Messaging Dapp 
This project is our team's solution for an academic project.

The design of our application is based on a thorough analysis of the required needs and functionalities.

- We have emphasized the management and creation of user accounts, ensuring the security of private keys through the use of MetaMask and seed phrases.
  
- User authentication is done securely using a password and temporarily storing the private key in session storage.

- Message management provides a comprehensive range of features, including scheduled sending, drafts, direct replies, and message sharing.
  
-  File management is simplified through the use of the decentralized IPFS network, ensuring permanent file availability and security through encryption and the use of Pinata's pinning service.
  
- Our application offers a secure, reliable, and user-friendly messaging experience, meeting the needs of modern communication.
